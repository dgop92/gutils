# Family of undirected graph

## Complete graph

Notation: Kn

Characteristics:

* m = n(n - 1)/2
* (n - 1) - regular


## Null graph

Notation: Nn

Characteristics:

* m = 0
* 0 - regular

## Path graph

Notation: Pn

Characteristics:

* m = n - 1
* d(v_1) = d(v_n) = 1
* Cuando i esta en [2, n-1], d(v_i) = 2

Conditions:

* n >= 3

## Cycle graph

Notation: Cn

Characteristics:

* m = n
* 2-regular

Conditions:

* n >= 3

## Wheel graph

Notation: Wn

Characteristics:

* m = 2(n - 1)
* 3-regular

Conditions:

* Same condition as cycle graph

## Regular graph

Same degree for all nodes

Notation: r-regular

Characteristics:

* r = d(v)

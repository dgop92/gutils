# GUtils CLI

CLI containing a set of utilities for Graph Theory

The algorithms and code may not be the most efficient because the project aims to create a "helper" for the subject

## Project setup

First of all, you need to have Python 3.6+ due to the use of typer that relies on type hints

Set up an environment using python venv

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment and install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can find help about the commands using

```
gutils.py --help
```
